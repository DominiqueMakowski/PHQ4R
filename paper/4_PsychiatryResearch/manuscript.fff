Prevalence of answer pairs. C) Item Information Curves from IRT showing
the coverage by each item and response of the latent dimension.
Typically, an optimally informative item would display a large coverage
over theta, with each response presenting a narrow coverage (high
discrimination between different levels).}{\label{fig-one}}}}

{\caption{{A) PHQ-4 depression and anxiety scores against their
respective ground-truth measures, the BDI-22 and the STAI-5. Bayes
factors in grey tell if there is a difference, for the same PHQ-4 score,
between the original and the refined version (BFs \textless{} 1 suggest
no difference and thus evidence for a comparability of the refined
version with respect fo the original scale. Bayes factors in yellow
represent how new in-between scores (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, \ldots) available
with refined version differ from the adjacent scores (BFs \textgreater{}
3 suggest that half a point of difference on the refined PHQ-4 relates
to a significant difference on the ground truth measure). BF \textless{}
1/3Â°, BF \textgreater{} 3*, BF \textgreater{} 10**, BF \textgreater{}
30***. B) Bootstrapped distributions of the difference of correlation
between the revised PHQ-4 scores and the original one for sub-clinical
threshold scores of depression and anxiety. Positive differences suggest
that the correlation between the ground-truth measure and the refined
PHQ-4 score was stronger compared to the original version. C) Predictive
power of the PHQ-4 scores on the presence of a depression or anxiety
disorder. The upper plots show the relationship modelled by a logistic
regression, while the above plots represent the ROC curves (in which a
line further away from the diagonal represents a higher combination of
sensitivity and specificity).}{\label{fig-two}}}}
