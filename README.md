# Adaptation of the PHQ-4 Short Screening for Depression and Anxiety to increase its Sensitivity to Subclinical Variability


The PHQ-4 consists of two validated ultra-brief screeners for depression (PHQ–2) and anxiety (GAD–2).

> Over the **last 2 weeks**, how often have you been bothered by the following problems?
>
>   - **Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge**
>   - **Not being able to stop or control worrying**
>   - **Little interest or pleasure in doing things**
>   - **Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless**

0: **"Not at all"**, 0.5: **"Once or twice**, 1: **"Several days"**, 2: **"More than half the days"**, 3: **"Nearly every day"**

In this brief study, we test the addition of the "Once or twice" response option to increase the scale's sensitivity to subclinical variability.
